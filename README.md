## Introduction
InfoColorizer is a tool that allows users to effectively obtain high-quality color palettes during infographics creation. 
It consists of a recommendation engine and a visual interface.
From a large infographic dataset, we extract a set of features that embeds both structure and color information of infographics (the red arrow). 
We then train a deep learning model, VAEAC, that characterizes good color design practices in the data, to construct our recommendation engine. 
With the visual interface, users can obtain recommended color palettes, specify various color preferences and constraints, preview and edit infographics, 
and retrieve new recommendations in an iterative manner (the blue arrows).

## Feature Extraction Algorithm
As described in [Section 5.1.1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.02041.pdf), we extract features at different levels and construct a tree that captures spatial relationship of infographic elements. The corresponding code is mainly at [./backend/treeconstructor](backend/treeconstructor).
